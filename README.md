### Hi there I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

I have been developing for years. After I got my Masters in Information Technology I was using VB.Net professionally. This is when I learned SQL

I have since learned C# and used it professionally.

I have learned ASP.Net Core MVC and have created several projects in it.

I have spent time learning Python, Django, JavaScript and React. 

I have created a Task List in React that stores the tasks in local storage: [https://taskmate.michaelsworld.net/]

I have created a small E-commerce site that uses an API to get and store information: [https://codebook.michaelsworld.net/]

I have been focusing on React and decided to learn Angular, which I am working through.
